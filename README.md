## Key Steps
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyzed the distribution of data and relationships between features such as age, gender, physical activity, and dietary habits.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values, normalized numerical data, and encoded categorical variables to enhance model performance.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Identified impactful features contributing to obesity levels, improving model accuracy.

4. **Model Selection:**
   - Tested various machine learning models, including:
     - KNeighborsClassifier
     - SVC (Support Vector Classifier)
     - RandomForestClassifier
     - GradientBoostingClassifier
     - VotingClassifier
     - DecisionTreeClassifier
     - XGBoost (XGBClassifier)

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Compared models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The top-performing model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy]%!

## Project Insights
